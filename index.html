                This is my first big team project for the 3rd year. It was advertised long before the event. 
                It was a week-long intensive startup development, which was attended by more than 100 people. 
                <br><br>It was held on the territory of the Special Economic Zone in Dubna.

                In 2022 February was AeroSpace Pro Hackathon. It was amazing 2 days of persistent work. I was capitan 
                of my team of 5 people. In this days we try to parse many data from some detectors. After 1 day of work we 
                can parse it and understand what leads want from us. But later we were told that only one of our thoughts 
                were correct. We rearrange our way of working. So we create programm which visualize this data.
                <br><br>I would like to say a special thanks to our university teachers.
