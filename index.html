                        This is my first big team project for the 3rd year. It was advertised long before the event. 
                        It was a week-long intensive startup development, which was attended by more than 100 people. 
                        <br><br>It was held on the territory of the Special Economic Zone in Dubna.

                        In 2022 February was AeroSpace Pro Hackathon. It was amazing 2 days of persistent work. I 
                        was capitan of my team of 5 people. In this days we try to parse many data from some 
                        detectors. After 1 day of work we can parse it and understand what leads want from us. 
                        But later we were told that only one of our thoughts were correct. We rearrange our way 
                        of working. So we create programm which visualize this data.
                        <br><br>I would like to say a special thanks to our university teachers.
